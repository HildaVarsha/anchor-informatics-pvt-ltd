        Bringing all of our research findings, we meet with you to develop a
        rock-solid value proposition and establish the major assumptions to
        prove. Then we develop the first draft of your consumers experience
        through your product. These early user stories will be used to assess
        the features in the following stage, Product Rationale.

        assumptions to prove, and first user stories

        the definitive list of User Stories and features that are required to
        substantiate the primary assumptions in a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
        or Proof of Concept (POC). Our team of experts in Tech Architecture,
        UX/UI, and Product will concentrate on addressing all inquiries that
        have arisen during our collaborative endeavor.
